# = Cinch TickingAway::TimeInfo plugin
# This plugin enables Cinch to respond to !timeat <tz_info> and
# !timepopularity <tz_info or prefix> commands.
#
# !timeat <tz_info> will respond with the current time for the
# provided timezone according to the World Time Api or any other
# provided time Api that conforms to the spec.
#
# !timepopularity <tz_info or prefix> will respond with the number
# of times !timeat was called successfully for the provided tz_info or
# prefix. For instance, "!timepopularity America" will return the
# number of times "!timeat America" was called, but it will also
# count the number of times "!timeat America/Los_Angeles" or
# "!timeat America/New_York" was called because they both contain
# the prefix "America"
#
#
# == Configuration
# Add the following to your bot’s configure.do stanza:
#
#   config.plugins.options[TickingAway::TimeInfo] = {
#     :time_api => 'https://worldtimeapi.org/api'
#   }
#
# [time_api ('https://worldtimeapi.org/api')]
#   The time is retreived from a time Api. It requires the spec to match
#   the World Time Api. If this is not specified either through the config,
#   or by providing the ENV var TIME_API, it will default to https://worldtimeapi.org/api
